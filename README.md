# Spotify2Deezer

This is a companion app for Deezloader or SMLoader, you can use it to convert Spotify playlist to a list of Deezer links that you can just copy paste to either of the two applications mentioned and download song more fast and efficiently than doing it manually.

## Use
You just need to copy the playlist link from spotify (using the share button inside the app) and paste it in the program using the **right click**, after a few seconds you will be presented a string you can copy to Deezloader or SMLoader to download all your songs automatically.
